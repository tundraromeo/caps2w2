### Performance
- Large date ranges with lots of data may take longer to generate
- The system processes each report type sequentially
- Progress is shown in the console (check browser developer tools if needed)

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Found
**Problem**: PDF shows "No data available" for some report types

**Solutions**:
1. Check if data actually exists in the database for that period
2. Use **"Check Available Data"** to see available date ranges
3. Adjust date range to period with known data
4. Verify database records exist for those report types

### PDF Not Downloading
**Problem**: Clicking download button doesn't generate PDF

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Ensure at least one report type is selected
3. Verify date range is valid (start date before end date)
4. Check if browser is blocking pop-ups/downloads
5. Try with a smaller date range

### Slow Generation
**Problem**: PDF takes a long time to generate

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce the date range (e.g., 1 week instead of 1 month)
2. Select fewer report types
3. Check network connection
4. Wait patiently - large reports take time

### Wrong Data Displayed
**Problem**: PDF shows wrong dates or data

**Solutions**:
1. Double-check selected date range in modal
2. Verify report type checkboxes are correct
3. Review the green confirmation box before downloading
4. Generate again with correct selections

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Small**: Try generating a single day's report first to verify data
2. **Use Quick Select**: For common date ranges, quick select is faster than custom dates
3. **Check Data First**: Always use "Check Available Data" for important reports
4. **Multiple Formats**: Generate different combinations for different audiences
5. **Regular Reports**: Set up regular report generation (daily, weekly, monthly)
6. **Naming Convention**: Save PDFs with clear, descriptive names on your computer
7. **Archive Reports**: Keep historical PDFs for reference and compliance

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Email delivery of combined reports
- Scheduled automatic report generation
- Custom report templates
- Export to Excel/CSV formats
- More report types (Login Logs, Supplier Reports)
- Report comparison features
